# SquadPlanner Roadmap

Full audit and reasoning: **https://claude.ai/code/artifact/bce3dcff-8a5b-4eea-ac81-c516a2d081e2**

This file is the working checklist. The dossier explains *why* each item is here, with sources.

Goal: a hiring manager concludes "this person ships production multi-agent systems," **and** a real
group can use the product. Constraint: free / near-free tiers.

---

## Phase 0 — Close the doors  ·  BLOCKS EVERYTHING

Eight endpoints have no authentication. All are live on the deployed demo.

- [ ] `GET /api/trips` — **dumps every trip in the DB**; `?email=` enumerates any user. Delete the
      query param, derive the user from the token, add pagination
- [ ] `POST /api/trips/{id}/refine` — **unauthenticated free text into an LLM prompt on a stranger's
      trip**. Auth + membership check
- [ ] `POST /api/trips` — unauthenticated trip creation that **sends invite emails**. Open mail relay
- [ ] `GET /api/trips/{id}` · `/result` · `/stream` — IDOR on emails, budgets, dietary data
- [ ] `POST /api/trips/{id}/confirm-city` — anyone can hijack the HITL decision (OWASP LLM06)
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/serpapi-usage` — needs an admin guard
- [ ] `auth.py:34` `secure=False` → environment-driven
- [ ] `main.py:23` CORS hardcoded to localhost → env var (production origin currently blocked)
- [ ] `slowapi` rate limits: per-IP on auth, per-user on generate/refine
- [ ] Mongo indexes: `trip_id`, `invite_code`, `created_by`; **TTL index on `api_cache`** (grows forever)
- [ ] JWT revocation — 7-day token, logout only clears the cookie
- [ ] `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` mapped to OWASP LLM Top 10 + Agentic Top 10

## Phase 1 — Make it measurable

**Complete.** Spec: `docs/phases/PHASE_1.md`. Baseline: `backend/evals/baseline.json`.

- [x] Tracing — LangSmith rather than Langfuse (D-011), with member-email redaction
- [x] Offline replay layer so the graph runs for $0 with no network (not in the original list;
      every item below depends on it)
- [x] Golden set — 30 offline cases and 5 live cases, seeded from the demo and manual fixtures
- [x] Deterministic scorers: budget, fairness, dietary, hard avoids, dates, radius, geo sanity,
      flight alignment, schema completeness
- [x] LLM-as-judge for coherence, fairness and pitch quality — **and calibrated against human
      labels, which it failed** (D-016). Judge scores are not usable as a standalone metric.
- [x] **Trajectory evals** — nodes run, retry loops fired, rebuild bounds, tool args valid
- [x] Token + cost + latency per node, persisted on the trip, exposed at
      `GET /api/trips/{trip_id}/telemetry` and rendered in the debug UI
- [x] Fix the 2 failing tests in `test_preference_constraints.py`
- [x] Delete the 3 empty test files
- [~] Nightly run via the Batches API — **dropped** (D-015): the saving is cents against the cost
      of async job-polling code

Findings from the phase: `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` K-001 to K-011 and `docs/PRODUCT_FEEDBACK.md`.
Nineteen of the twenty-nine product findings have no home in Phases 2-8 as currently written; that
gap is the next planning task.

## Phase 2 — Harden the model boundary

- [ ] Replace 6 `json.loads(_strip_json_fences(...))` sites with `.with_structured_output()` + repair retry
      — `output_assembler.py`, `preference_constraints.py`, `destination_selector.py`, `subgraphs/itinerary.py`
- [ ] Input guardrails on `preference_notes` / `group_notes` / refinement text
- [ ] Output guardrail: explicit pass/fail itinerary validation layer
- [ ] Venue validity: check Places `business_status` + `opening_hours` against the scheduled day

## Phase 3 — Ground it (RAG)

- [ ] Corpus: Wikivoyage (CC-BY-SA) + NPS + tourism boards → few thousand chunks
- [ ] Hybrid retrieval — BM25 + dense, RRF fusion, cross-encoder rerank (top-50 → top-5)
- [ ] Ground 3 nodes: destination rationale **with citations**, itinerary pacing, constraint resolution
- [ ] Agentic re-retrieval (self-RAG / corrective RAG) when a claim isn't supported
- [ ] Retrieval evals: precision@k, faithfulness, citation accuracy
- [ ] Publish **venue validity rate** before/after
- [ ] Chroma or FAISS on disk = $0

## Phase 4 — Genuinely multi-agent

- [ ] **Advocate agent per traveler** (parallel fan-out, disjoint context) + **Negotiator**, max 2 rounds
- [ ] Log every objection — "whose preference lost and why" is the demo moment
- [ ] Critic agent with structured revision notes
- [ ] Model routing by node (Haiku for extraction, stronger for planning/critic)
- [ ] Prompt caching on the stable prefix; verify `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`
- [ ] Publish before/after cost per trip

## Phase 5 — Memory

- [ ] Per-user profile: semantic (dietary), episodic (accepted edits), procedural (pacing habits)
- [ ] Consolidation, not just accumulation

## Phase 6 — Durable execution

- [ ] Move graph execution out of the SSE request (`utils/streaming.py:86`) into a worker
- [ ] Resumable streams — reconnect and replay from the checkpoint (the checkpointer already persists state)
- [ ] Idempotency keys on emails and paid API calls
- [ ] Dead-letter queue + retry policy

## Phase 7 — Product

- [ ] **Group voting** at the HITL pause (currently leader-only)
- [ ] **Settle-up** built on the existing fairness scoring
- [ ] Bookable deep links from SerpAPI data already fetched
- [ ] `.ics` export + shareable read-only trip link
- [ ] Email nudges for members who haven't submitted preferences
- [ ] Mobile-responsive itinerary — *Vignesh*

## Phase 8 — Legibility

- [x] `docker-compose.yml`: backend + frontend (nginx) — *partial: uses each user's own Atlas instead
  of a Mongo container, and LangSmith instead of Langfuse (D-011). See `docs/DOCKER.md`.*
- [ ] GitHub Actions: deterministic tests + eval suite per PR
- [ ] Architecture diagram generated from the compiled graph
- [ ] README rewrite: what it is → diagram → agent roster → evals → cost → demo GIF → setup
- [ ] Resolve `showcase/` vs `frontend/`
- [ ] Split `agent/subgraphs/itinerary.py` (1,330 lines, ~50 helpers) into clustering / planner / routing / validation

## Stretch — after Phase 0 only

- [ ] Expose SquadPlanner as an **MCP server** so a trip can be planned from inside Claude/ChatGPT
